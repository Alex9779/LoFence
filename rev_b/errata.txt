1) Power supply
I never used a DC to DC converter before and wasn't sure if it could interfere with the RN2483 or ADC.
Therefore in addition I placed a LDO as a backup on the board as well.
The DC to DC converter works fine, so the LDO (U2, C2, C3) can be left unpopulated.

2) Resistor divider
Instead of
  [Fence+]--[10M]--[10M]--[1M]--[Measure]--[5k8]--[Fence-/GND]

I probably should have done
  [+12kV]--[10M]--[1M]--[Measure]--[5k8]--[GND]--[10M]--[Fence-]
